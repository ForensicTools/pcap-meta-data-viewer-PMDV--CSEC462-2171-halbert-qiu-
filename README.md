# pcap-meta-data-viewer-PMDV--CSEC462-2171-halbert-qiu-
Our project is to make a visualization tool that takes a pcap file and uses it to create a
topology diagram where computers are listed by IP addresses. The tool then takes the network
traffic from the pcap or data collection to trace the network traffic to determine where the 
traffic is going geographically during a set time frame to determine if someone is being 
productive during work times or if data is being sent to irregular locations. We will be using
the following tools for piping data into our tool: tcpdump, tshark, wireshark and possibly Asyn.

Could we get some more info on asyn and how it links ip addresses to locations? You mentioned
this in class.
