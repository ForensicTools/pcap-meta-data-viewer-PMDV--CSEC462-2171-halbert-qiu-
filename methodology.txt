For our project visualization, we are using D3.js for the graphical representation.
In short, we will grab the location of websites that are visited and pipe them into our
algorithm. Using this information, we will present a world map of all the connections made from
our host.

Pseudo-code:

for each website visited from a list:
  grab the ip of the site host
  put each ip into a list

for each ip in list:
  map the ip to a location on the map (coordinates, city, country or province)
  send the location to the .js for graphical representation

returns the map of the locations

Other code and tools will be used to gather the ip addresses from the sites.
